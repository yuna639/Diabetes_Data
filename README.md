---

## üß† Methodology

### **Input**

* Raw dataset (`diabetes_final_standardized.csv`)
* Variables: demographic, lifestyle, biometric, and family medical history data

### **Process**

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Standardize continuous variables
   * One-hot encode categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visual correlation, clustering, and pattern recognition

3. **Modeling**
   * Linear Regression to predict BMI (proxy for diabetes risk)









I have used **linear regression** to model the relationship between a predictor variable and the binary outcome of being classified as **obese (1)** or **not obese (0)** based on BMI.



### üìä Chart 1: **BMI vs BMI Category**

**Title:** *Linear Regression: BMI vs BMI Category*

* **X-axis:** `BMI` (Body Mass Index)
* **Y-axis:** `bmi_category_code` (numeric code for BMI category: 0 = Normal, 1 = Overweight, 2 = Obese)
* **Observations:**

  * Three horizontal clusters corresponding to Normal, Overweight, and Obese.
  * The red regression line slopes upward, indicating a **positive association**: higher BMI values correspond to higher BMI category codes.
  * Continuous BMI values allow a clear trend across categories.
  * The confidence interval around the line visualizes model certainty.

---

### üìä Chart 2: **Waist-to-Hip Ratio vs BMI Category**

**Title:** *Linear Regression: Waist-to-Hip Ratio vs BMI Category*

* **X-axis:** `waist_to_hip_ratio`
* **Y-axis:** `bmi_category_code`
* **Observations:**

  * Clustering across the three BMI categories is visible.
  * The regression line slopes upward, showing that **higher waist-to-hip ratios** are associated with higher BMI categories.
  * This aligns with clinical understanding that visceral fat (measured by waist-to-hip ratio) is a predictor of obesity.

---

### üìä Chart 3: **Triglycerides vs BMI Category**

**Title:** *Linear Regression: Triglycerides vs BMI Category*

* **X-axis:** `triglycerides` (blood fat levels)
* **Y-axis:** `bmi_category_code`
* **Observations:**

  * The numeric encoding shows three discrete outcome levels, with higher triglycerides tending toward higher BMI categories.
  * The regression line shows a **positive trend**, indicating that higher triglyceride levels are associated with higher BMI category codes.
  * Supports the role of metabolic markers in obesity risk.

---

### üìä Chart 4: **Insulin Level vs BMI Category**

**Title:** *Linear Regression: Insulin Level vs BMI Category*

* **X-axis:** `insulin_level`
* **Y-axis:** `bmi_category_code`
* **Observations:**

  * Outcome clusters correspond to BMI categories.
  * The regression line slopes upward, suggesting that **higher insulin levels** are linked to higher BMI categories.
  * Consistent with insulin resistance being common in overweight and obese individuals.

---

### üìä Chart 5: **BMI Overweight vs BMI Category**

**Title:** *Linear Regression: BMI Overweight vs BMI Category*

* **X-axis:** `bmi_category_code` or a binary derived from BMI category (e.g., 1 = Overweight, 0 = otherwise)
* **Y-axis:** `bmi_category_code`
* **Observations:**

  * Very limited points if using a binary Overweight indicator.
  * Regression line may slope downward slightly because Overweight and Obese are mutually exclusive in the binary encoding.
  * This predictor is **categorical**, so linear regression is not ideal, and interpretation should be cautious.

### üîç Comparative Analysis

| Chart | Predictor Variable   | Association with BMI Category | Type of Variable | Strength of Insight |
| ----- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | BMI                  | Positive                      | Continuous       | Strong              |
| 2     | Waist-to-Hip Ratio   | Positive                      | Continuous       | Strong              |
| 3     | Triglycerides        | Positive                      | Continuous       | Moderate‚ÄìStrong     |
| 4     | Insulin Level        | Positive                      | Continuous       | Moderate‚ÄìStrong     |
| 5     | Overweight Indicator | Slight Negative / Weak        | Binary           | Weak / Limited      |

---

### üß† Key Takeaways

* **Continuous predictors** like BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides, and insulin levels show **clear positive trends** with BMI category codes.
* **Binary or categorical predictors** (e.g., Overweight indicator) are less suitable for linear regression due to mutual exclusivity and limited data points.
* Regression on numeric-coded BMI categories allows visualization of trends across all three groups (Normal ‚Üí Overweight ‚Üí Obese).
* Confidence intervals help assess the reliability of predictions‚Äînarrower bands indicate stronger predictive relationships.
* Linear regression provides a **general trend**, but for categorical outcomes, other models (logistic regression, ordinal regression) may provide more accurate predictions.

### üîç Comparative Analysis

| Chart | Predictor Variable | Correlation with Obesity | Type of Variable | Strength of Insight |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1     | BMI                | Positive                 | Continuous       | Strong              |
| 2     | Waist-to-Hip Ratio| Positive                 | Continuous       | Strong              |
| 3     | Triglycerides      | Positive                 | Continuous       | Moderate‚ÄìStrong     |
| 4     | Insulin Level      | Positive                 | Continuous       | Moderate‚ÄìStrong     |
| 5     | BMI Overweight     | Negative                 | Binary           | Weak (limited data) |

---

### üß† Key Takeaways
- **BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides, and insulin levels** all show **positive correlations** with obesity classification, reinforcing their roles as risk factors.
- The **BMI Overweight vs Obese** chart is more categorical and less informative due to limited data and mutual exclusivity.
- Charts with **continuous predictors** (BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, etc.) provide more nuanced insights and are better suited for regression modeling.
- The **confidence intervals** across all charts help visualize uncertainty‚Äînarrower bands suggest stronger predictive power.
