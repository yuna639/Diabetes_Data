Diabetes Health Analytics Report
Non-Technical Summary

This project investigates the factors that contribute to diabetes risk using a comprehensive dataset of 100,001 anonymized individuals. Key features include age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, lifestyle habits such as alcohol consumption, diet quality, physical activity, sleep patterns, and family medical history.

The primary goal was to identify patterns and correlations between these features and health outcomes, particularly BMI and blood pressure, which are strong indicators of diabetes and cardiovascular risk. Using an interactive dashboard, stakeholders can explore trends, filter by demographics, and visualize relationships between lifestyle habits and health indicators.

Key findings include:

BMI and Lifestyle: Individuals with lower physical activity levels and higher screen time tend to have higher BMI values, increasing their diabetes risk.

Diet and Alcohol Consumption: Poor diet scores combined with higher alcohol intake correlate with increased cardiovascular risk.

Family History: A positive family history of diabetes significantly raises individual risk, irrespective of lifestyle factors.

Age Factor: Older adults are more likely to have hypertension and elevated BMI, confirming age as a major risk predictor.

The dashboard allows healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers to easily identify high-risk groups, enabling targeted interventions and preventive strategies. For example, a patient with high BMI, low activity, and poor diet can receive personalized recommendations to reduce diabetes risk.

In summary, the analysis demonstrates that lifestyle modification, early intervention, and family history awareness are key levers in reducing diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The visualizations and models provide clear, actionable insights for decision-making.

Technical Summary

The project employed Python-based data analysis and AI-assisted visualization to explore correlations, identify risk factors, and predict BMI as a proxy for diabetes susceptibility. The dataset contained 49 features, including continuous variables (age, activity minutes, diet score, sleep hours) and categorical variables (BMI category, blood pressure, smoking status).

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Standardized continuous variables, one-hot encoded categorical features, handled missing values, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Visual Analytics:

Correlation Heatmap: Spearman correlation identified strong relationships between BMI, age, activity, and family history.

Pairplots & Regression Plots: Visualized interactions between key continuous variables and outcomes.

Parallel Coordinates Plot: Revealed multidimensional patterns among high-risk individuals.

UMAP Dimensionality Reduction: Reduced 49-dimensional data to 2D for pattern discovery and clustering.

Predictive Modeling: Linear regression was applied to predict BMI from key variables (age, activity, diet score). Model evaluation yielded:

R²: 0.68, indicating that the model explains a significant portion of BMI variability.

MSE: Low enough to confirm predictive relevance for risk assessment.

Validation & Testing: Random sampling and visualization ensured robustness, while correlations and regression plots confirmed hypotheses regarding risk factors.

Key Technical Outcomes:

BMI and physical activity are inversely related, while screen time and alcohol consumption positively correlate with BMI.

Family history remains the strongest categorical predictor of elevated BMI and diabetes risk.

Age demonstrates a monotonic relationship with hypertension and BMI, validated via Spearman correlation.

Dashboard visualizations allow dynamic exploration of the data, including filters for demographics, BMI category, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits.

Conclusion:

The analysis validates the initial hypotheses, confirming that lifestyle factors, age, and family history significantly influence diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The combination of interactive visualizations, linear regression, and dimensionality reduction provides a robust and actionable framework for healthcare professionals and policy makers to design targeted interventions. This project showcases how data-driven insights can effectively translate into real-world health strategies while remaining accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
